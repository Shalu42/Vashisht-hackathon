Hello everyone! Today, I'm excited to share with you our project on breast cancer prediction using machine learning.
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer affecting women worldwide.
Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.
Our project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer.
By analyzing relevant data, we can develop models that assist in early detection and treatment planning.
